This repository contains the research paper An Evaluation of Modern Text Summarization Methods, which was submitted as a final project for the course COMP 4750 - Natural Language Processing during my senior year. The paper explores and compares various state-of-the-art text summarization techniques, and provides insights into their performance and effectiveness.

## Overview
The research paper delves into the following topics:

1. Introduction to text summarization and its importance in the era of information overload.
2. Overview of different text summarization approaches, including extractive and abstractive methods.
3. Analysis of current state-of-the-art text summarization models, such as BERT, GPT, and T5.
4. A detailed comparison of these models in terms of accuracy, coherence, and efficiency.
5. Discussion on the challenges and future prospects of text summarization research.
